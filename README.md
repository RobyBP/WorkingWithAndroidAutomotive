### Creating a new document

When creating a new document, adhere to the standards set by previous documents. 

The topics should be closely related to **Android Automotive** so there is no need to cover every aspect of the _Android OS_. 

If your documentation contains images, create a directory named after the document you are currently writing and store the images and the document in the same directory.

Try to keep your documentation brief and straight to the point (no need to just copy from google docs).
