* **Messaging apps** - let users receive incoming notifications, read messages aloud using text-to-speech, and send replies via voice input in the car (Only for [[Android Auto]])
* **Navigation apps** - help users get where the want to go by providing turn by turn directions. To develop these apps use [[Android for Cars App Library]]
* **Point of interest (POI) apps** - let users discover and navigate to points of interest and take relevant actions, such as parking, charging, and fuel apps. To develop these apps use [[Android for Cars App Library]]
* **Internet of Things (IOT) apps** - let users interact with the connected devices from within the car (opening garage doors, flipping home light switches...). To develop these apps use [[Android for Cars App Library]]
